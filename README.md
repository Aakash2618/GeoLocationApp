# GeoExplorer

GeoExplorer is a modern, interactive web application built with React and TypeScript that allows users to explore geographic locations on a map. Leveraging the power of Leaflet and OpenStreetMap, GeoExplorer provides an intuitive interface for searching locations, viewing user position, and interacting with map markers.

## Features

- **User Location Detection:** Automatically detects and displays the user's current location on the map.
- **Location Search:** Search for places worldwide using the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API with autocomplete and minimum character validation.
- **Local and Global Search:** Performs local bounded searches around the user's location for relevant results, with a global fallback if no local results are found.
- **Distance Sorting:** Search results are sorted by distance from the user's current location for convenience.
- **Interactive Map Markers:** Add markers for selected locations with informative popups displaying place name, type, and distance.
- **Responsive UI:** Clean and responsive design using Tailwind CSS and lucide-react icons for a modern look and feel.
- **Smooth Map Navigation:** Map automatically pans and zooms to selected locations with smooth animations.
